A) The player inputs a number of rounds for the game [function getRounds()]    
    A-1) Prompt the player for a number of rounds [sub-function promptPlayer()]
    A-2) Check if number of rounds chosen by the user is valid [sub-function testRounds()]
         else back to A-1)
    [return number of rounds]

B) The player inputs his answer [function getPlayerAnswer()]
    B-1) Prompt the player for a choice [sub-function promptPlayer]
    B-2) Check if player's choice is valid by comparison with array of valid answers [sub-function testAnswer()]
         else back to B-1)
    [return player's answer]

C) The computer makes a random answer [function getComputerAnswer()]
    C-1) Generate a random integer [sub-function getRdmInt()]
    C-2) Associate the random integer with a positon in the array of valid answers [sub-function getRdmAnswer()]
    [return computer's answer]

D) Answers are compared, round winner is annouced [function getRoundWinner()]
    D-1) Compare player's answer vs computer's answer [sub-function compareAnswers()]
    [return round winner]

E) Adjust scores [function adjustScores(roundWinner)]
    [return adjusted winner's score]

F) Look for end of game or for more rounds [function isEndOfGame(rounds)]
    F-1) Decrease remaining number of rounds [sub-function decreaseRounds(rounds)]
        [return remainingRounds]
    F-2) Check if there is another round to play [sub-function isMoreRounds(remainingRounds)]
        [loop back to B)] else F-3)
    F-3) Announce the winner of the game [function EndOfGame()]


>>> The above plan has been compromised during coding XD
