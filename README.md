# TheOdinProject-RockPaperScissors

This is a JavaScript coding project which is part of the Foundations Course of The Odin Project.
The goal was to learn the basic of problem solving, working with a plan.
I have played with variables scope, calling functions and returning values.
Also I have worked on using conditionals inside literals.

TO PLAY THE GAME : use the JavaScript console by right-clicking on the opened index.html and selecting "inspect element".
